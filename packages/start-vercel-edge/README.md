# start-vercel-edte

Adapter for Solid apps that work on Vercel Edge Functions.

This is very experimental; the adapter API isn't at all fleshed out, and things will definitely change.

## Configuration

Need to have vercel-cli installed globally. And run `vercel ./dist` once to link project after build for `npm start` to work.
